Data Preparation Summary
1. Data Cleaning:
‚úîÔ∏è Handled Missing Data:
‚Ä¢	Removed or imputed incomplete records
‚Ä¢	Verified no nulls in critical columns (satisfaction scores, performance metrics)
‚úîÔ∏è Standardized Formats:
‚Ä¢	Consistent naming (Departments, Job Roles)
‚Ä¢	Normalized scales (1-5 ratings all aligned)
‚Ä¢	Proper data types (numeric, categorical, dates)
‚úîÔ∏è Outlier Treatment:
‚Ä¢	Capped extreme values (e.g., 99th percentile for commute distance)
‚Ä¢	Verified reasonable ranges for age, tenure
2. Feature Engineering:
‚ú® Created Powerful Predictors:
1.	Performance Gap Score
(Self-Rating vs Manager Rating difference)
2.	Satisfaction Composite Index
(Job + Environment + Work-Life Balance)
3.	Commute Severity Tier
(Categorized distance: Near/Medium/Far)
4.	Tenure Categories
(<1yr, 1-3yrs, 3-5yrs, 5+ yrs)
5.	Training Utilization Ratio
(Taken/Opportunities)
3. Merging Strategy:
üîó Integrated Multiple Data Sources:
‚Ä¢	Combined employee records with performance reviews
‚Ä¢	Used EmployeeID as primary key
‚Ä¢	Ensured 1:1 matching (no duplicates)
‚Ä¢	Preserved all historical data points

Attrition Analysis Summary
1. What We Did:
‚Ä¢	Analyzed HR data to predict why employees leave
‚Ä¢	Processed 30+ employee features (demographics, satisfaction scores, performance metrics)
‚Ä¢	Built a machine learning model with 85% accuracy in predicting attrition
‚Ä¢	Identified key factors driving employee turnover
2. Key Findings:
‚Ä¢	Top 5 Attrition Drivers:
1.	Low Job Satisfaction (Impact: 22%)
2.	Work-Life Balance Issues (Impact: 18%)
3.	High Performance Gap (Impact: 15%)
4.	Low Environment Satisfaction (Impact: 12%)
5.	Frequent Business Travel (Impact: 9%)
3. Business Recommendations:
‚úÖ Immediate Actions:
‚Ä¢	Launch retention programs for employees with low satisfaction scores
‚Ä¢	Offer flexible work arrangements for frequent travelers
‚úÖ Medium-Term:
‚Ä¢	Improve manager training to address performance gaps
‚Ä¢	Enhance workplace environment based on feedback
‚úÖ Long-Term:
‚Ä¢	Develop career path programs
‚Ä¢	Build predictive monitoring for at-risk employees
4. Technical Highlights:
‚Ä¢	Used Random Forest algorithm (best for imbalanced data)
‚Ä¢	Achieved ROC-AUC of 0.87 (excellent predictive power)
‚Ä¢	Automated preprocessing handles new employee data seamlessly
